# Dataset with European Portuguese and English

I needed a purely European Portuguese and English training dataset
in order to train my own LLaMA according to the requirements of my
customer, but all the datasets I could find are for Brazilian Portuguese
so I have to exclusively scrape European Portuguese websites and format
them while I'm on it into a form, which is usable for machine learning.
